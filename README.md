# Task Management System in Microsoft 365

## Step 1: Set Up Microsoft Planner

1. **
Create a Plan:
**
   - Open Microsoft Planner and create a new plan.
   - Name the plan, for example, "Daily Task Schedule".
   - Create buckets for each time slot, such as "8am-11am Client Calls", "11am-1pm Order Management", etc.

2. **
Add Tasks:
**
   - Within each bucket, add tasks for the specific activities.
   - Assign tasks to the respective team members.
   - Set due dates for each task, ensuring they coincide with the daily schedule.

## Step 2: Set Up Microsoft To Do

1. **
Create a Shared List:
**
   - Open Microsoft To Do and create a new list called "Daily Tasks".
   - Add tasks similar to the ones you created in Planner with specific time slots.
   - Share this list with all team members, so they can mark tasks as complete.

2. **
Assign and Schedule Tasks in To Do:
**
   - For each task, set reminders for the specific times.
   - Though tasks cannot be assigned to multiple people directly in To Do, detail responsibilities in the task descriptions or use subtasks.

## Step 3: Automate with Power Automate

### Automate Task Creation

1. **
Log into Power Automate:
**
   - Open Power Automate from your Microsoft 365 account.

2. **
Create a New Flow:
**
   - Start a new automated flow.

3. **
Trigger:
**
   - Use a recurrence trigger to set the flow to run daily at a specific time.

4. **
Planner Actions:
**
   1. **
Add Tasks to Planner:
**
      - Add an action to "Create task" in Microsoft Planner.
      - Define the Plan ID and Bucket ID. Set the task title and assign the tasks dynamically if possible.

5. **
To Do Actions:
**
   1. **
Create Tasks in To Do:
**
      - Add an action to "Create task" in Microsoft To Do for each team member.

### Track Task Completion

1. **
Trigger:
**
   - Set up another flow with a recurrence trigger to check tasks' status.

2. **
List Tasks in Planner:
**
   - Add an action to "List tasks" from the specific Planner.

3. **
Check Task Status:
**
   - Use conditions to check if tasks are completed.
   - Notify you or update a document/spreadsheet if tasks are pending or completed.

## Practical Example with Power Automate

### Create Daily Tasks in Planner

1. **
Start an Automated Flow:
**
   - Trigger: Recurrence (daily at 7 AM).

2. **
Create Task in Microsoft Planner:
**
   - Action: "Create a task".
   - Plan ID: [Select your plan]
   - Bucket ID: [Select appropriate bucket]
   - Title: "Client Calls"
   - Due Date: Today
   - Assign To: [Dynamic content or predefined users]

### Sync Tasks to To Do

1. **
Create Task in Microsoft To Do:
**
   - Action: "Create a task".
   - Title: "Client Calls"
   - Due Date: Today
   - Reminder Time: 8:00 AM

### Track Task Completion

1. **
Trigger at End of Day:
**
   - Recurrence set for the end of the workday.

2. **
List Tasks in Planner:
**
   - Action: "List tasks" in the Plan.

3. **
Condition to Check Status:
**
   - If Task Status is not Completed:
     - Action: Send notification to you/manager.
